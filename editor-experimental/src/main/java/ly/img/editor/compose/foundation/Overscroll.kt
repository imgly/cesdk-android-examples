/**
 * An OverscrollEffect represents a visual effect that displays when the edges of a scrolling
 * container have been reached with a scroll or fling. For the default platform effect that should
 * be used in most cases, see
 * [androidx.compose.foundation.gestures.ScrollableDefaults.overscrollEffect].
 *
 * OverscrollEffect conceptually 'decorates' scroll / fling events: consuming some of the delta or
 * velocity before and/or after the event is consumed by the scrolling container. [applyToScroll]
 * applies overscroll to a scroll event, and [applyToFling] applies overscroll to a fling.
 *
 * Higher level components such as [androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.LazyColumn] will automatically
 * configure an OverscrollEffect for you. To use a custom OverscrollEffect you first need to
 * provide it with scroll and/or fling events - usually by providing it to a
 * [androidx.compose.foundation.gestures.scrollable]. Then you can draw the effect on top of the
 * scrolling content using [Modifier.overscroll].

     * should be equal to `delta - performScroll(delta)`. The OverscrollEffect can optionally
     * consume some delta before calling [performScroll], such as to release any existing tension.
     * The implementation *must* call [performScroll] exactly once. This function should return the
     * sum of all the delta that was consumed during this operation - both by the overscroll and
     * [performScroll].

     * return the amount of delta we have consumed when updating the drag position. Note that we
     * also need to call applyToFling - this is used as an end signal for overscroll so that effects
     * can correctly reset after any animations, when the gesture has stopped.
