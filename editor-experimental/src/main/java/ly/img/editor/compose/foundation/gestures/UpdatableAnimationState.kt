/**
 * Holds state for an [animation][animateToZero] that will continuously animate a float [value] to
 * zero.
 *
 * Unlike the standard [AnimationState], this class allows the value to be changed while the
 * animation is running. When that happens, the next frame will continue animating the new value
 * to zero as though the previous animation was interrupted and restarted with the new value. See
 * the docs on [animateToZero] for more information.
 *
 * An analogy for how this animation works is gravity – you can pick something up, and as soon as
 * you let it go it will start falling to the ground. If you catch it and raise it higher, it will
 * continue falling from the new height.
 *
 * Similar behavior could be achieved by using an [AnimationState] and creating a new copy and
 * launching a new coroutine to call `animateTo(0f)` every time the value changes. However, this
 * class doesn't require allocating a new state object and launching/cancelling a coroutine to
 * update the value, which makes for a more convenient API for this particular use case, and makes
 * it cheaper to update [value] on every frame.

     * will continue running from the new value on the next frame.
     *
     * Simply setting this property will not start the animation – [animateToZero] must be manually
