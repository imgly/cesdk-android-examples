/**
 * Ongoing requests from [ContentInViewModifier.bringChildIntoView], with the invariant that it is
 * always sorted by overlapping order: each item's bounds completely overlaps the next item.
 *
 * Requests are enqueued by calling [enqueue], which inserts the request at the correct position
 * and cancels and removes any requests that it interrupts. When a request is enqueued, its
 * continuation has a completion handler set that will remove the request from the queue when
 * it's cancelled.
 *
 * One a request has been enqueued, it cannot be removed without completing the continuation.
 * This helps prevent leaking requests. Requests are removed in two ways:
 *  1. By an [enqueue] call for a request that doesn't overlap them, or
 *  2. By calling [cancelAndRemoveAll], which does exactly what it says.
