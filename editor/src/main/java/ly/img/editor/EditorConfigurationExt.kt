/**
 * A composable helper function that creates and remembers an [EngineConfiguration] instance when launching [DesignEditor].
 * It uses [EditorUiState] as its state.
 * In combination with the default [ly.img.editor.EngineConfiguration.Companion.rememberForDesign] it does the following:
 * 1. Displays loading during the editor load and the export
 * 2. Shows confirmation dialog in case there are unsaved changes when trying to close the editor
 * 3. Shows error dialog in case the editor encounters errors.
 *
 * @param uiMode the UI mode of the editor for theming purpose.
 * Default value is [EditorUiMode.SYSTEM].
 * @param navigationIcon the navigation icon in the toolbar that is used to exit the editor.
 * Default value is [IconPack.ArrowBack].
 * @param assetLibrary the asset library configuration object. Check the documentation of [AssetLibrary] for more details.
 * Default value is [AssetLibrary.getDefault].
 * @param colorPalette the default color palette used in the UI elements that contain color modifiers such as "Fill color",
 * "Stroke Color" etc.
 * Default value is [fillAndStrokeColors].
 * @param onEvent the callback that is invoked every time an event is sent via [ly.img.editor.core.event.EditorEventHandler] from
 * [EngineConfiguration].
 * Note that [ly.img.editor.core.event.EditorEventHandler.send] can be called in any of the callbacks of [EngineConfiguration]
 * and from composable functions in [EditorConfiguration].
 * By default [EditorDefaults.onEvent] is used to handle the callback.
 * @param overlay the composable that draws over the editor. It is useful if you want to display a popup dialog or anything in the
 * overlay. For example, you can send a ui event in one of the callbacks of the [EngineConfiguration], capture the event in
 * [onEvent], update your internal state and render in the overlay based on the state change. Check the implementation in
 * {solution_name}.get methods below for the sample usage of the composable callback.
 * Note that the overlay is edge-to-edge, therefore it is your responsibility to draw over system bars too.
 * By default [EditorDefaults.Overlay] is used to handle the composable callback.
 * @param dock the configuration object of the dock that is displayed as horizontal list of items at the bottom of the editor.
 * By default [ly.img.editor.core.component.Dock.Companion.rememberForDesign] is used to handle the composable callback.
 * @return an [EditorConfiguration] that should be used to launch a [DesignEditor].
