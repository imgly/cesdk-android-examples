/**
 * Built to provide versatile photo editing capabilities. Toggling from edit and preview modes enables users to evaluate their
 * edited photo before export. A dock at the bottom of the editor provides quick access to the most essential photo editing
 * tools allowing users to tweak adjustments, crop the photo, and add filters, effects, blur, text, shapes, as well as stickers.
 *
 * @param engineConfiguration the configuration object of the [ly.img.engine.Engine]. Check [EngineConfiguration] documentation
 * on how to create the object. It is recommended to use the default builder for [PhotoEditor]: [EngineConfiguration.getForPhoto].
 * @param editorConfiguration the configuration object of the UI. Check [EditorConfiguration] documentation
 * on how to create the object. Note that this parameter is optional. The default behavior is specified in the constructor of the class.
 * @param onClose the callback that is invoked when the editor is closed. Here are some of the recommended implementations:
 * 1. activity.finish() if the editor is launched in a standalone activity.
 * 2. fragmentManager.popBackStack() if the editor is launched in a fragment.
 * 3. navController.popBackStack() if the editor is launched as a new composable destination in NavHost.
 * If the optional parameter [Throwable] is not null, it means that the editor is closed due to an error.
 * The value is propagated from [ly.img.editor.core.event.EditorEventHandler.sendCloseEditorEvent]. Unless custom types are sent
 * to this function, the throwable is always going to be either an [EditorException] or [ly.img.engine.EngineException].
