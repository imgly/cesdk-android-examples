/**
 * Configuration class of the UI of the editor. All the properties are optional.
 * Use remember composable functions in the companion object to create an instance of this class.
 *
 * @param initialState the initial state of the editor. It is used to render the [overlay].
 * Initial state can then later be altered in [onEvent].
 * @param uiMode the UI mode of the editor for theming purpose.
 * @param navigationIcon the navigation icon in the toolbar that is used to exit the editor. A back arrow is used by default.
 * @param assetLibrary the asset library configuration object. Check the documentation of [AssetLibrary] for more details.
 * @param colorPalette the default color palette used in the UI elements that contain color modifiers such as "Fill color",
 * "Stroke Color" etc.
 * @param onEvent the callback that is invoked every time an event is sent via [ly.img.editor.core.event.EditorEventHandler] from
 * [EngineConfiguration].
 * Note that [ly.img.editor.core.event.EditorEventHandler.send] can be called in any of the callbacks of [EngineConfiguration]
 * and from composable functions in [EditorConfiguration].
 * @param overlay the composable that draws over the editor. It is useful if you want to display a popup dialog or anything in the
 * overlay. For example, you can send a ui event in one of the callbacks of the [EngineConfiguration], capture the event in
 * [onEvent], update your internal [STATE] and render in the overlay based on the state change. Check the implementation in
 * {solution_name}.get methods below for the sample usage of the composable callback.
 * Note that the overlay is edge-to-edge, therefore it is your responsibility to draw over system bars too.
 * @param dock the configuration object of the dock that is displayed as horizontal list of items at the bottom of the editor.
