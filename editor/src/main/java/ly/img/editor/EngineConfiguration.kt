/**
 * Configuration class of the [ly.img.engine.Engine] when launching the editor. All the properties are optional
 * except [license] and [onCreate]. Check helper implementations in the companion object of the class.
 *
 * @param license the license to activate the [ly.img.engine.Engine] with.
 * @param userId an optional unique ID tied to your application's user. This helps us accurately calculate monthly active users (MAU).
 * Especially useful when one person uses the app on multiple devices with a sign-in feature, ensuring they're counted once.
 * Providing this aids in better data accuracy.
 * @param baseUri the base Uri that is used to construct absolute paths from relative paths.
 * absolutePath = baseUri + relativePath.
 * For instance, baseUri can be set to android assets: file:///android_asset/.
 * After setting this path you can, for instance, load example.scene from assets/scenes folder using relative path:
 *      engine.scene.load(sceneUri = Uri.parse("scenes/example.scene"))
 * @param renderTarget the target which should be used by the [ly.img.engine.Engine] to render.
 * Default value is [EngineRenderTarget.SURFACE_VIEW].
 * @param onCreate the callback that is invoked when the editor is created. This is the main initialization block of both the editor
 * and engine. Normally, you should create/load a scene as well as prepare asset sources in this block.
 * We recommend that you check the availability of the scene before creating/loading a new scene since a recreated scene may already
 * exist if the callback is invoked after a process recreation.
 * Note that the "create" coroutine job will survive configuration changes and will be cancelled only if the editor is closed or the process is killed
 * when in the background.
 * Check [EditorDefaults.onCreate] for an example implementation.
 * @param onExport the callback that is invoked when the export button is clicked.
 * You may want to call one of the following functions in this callback: [ly.img.engine.BlockApi.export],
 * [ly.img.engine.BlockApi.exportWithColorMask], [ly.img.engine.BlockApi.exportVideo]. When the job is done, you can interact with
 * the UI by sending an event with [EditorEventHandler]. The event will be captured in [EditorConfiguration.onEvent]. Check
 * the default implementation of [onExport] for sample implementation.
 * Note that the "export" coroutine job will survive configuration changes and will be cancelled only if the editor is closed or the process is killed
 * when in the background.
 * @param onUpload the callback that is invoked after an asset is added to [UploadAssetSourceType]. When selecting an asset to upload,
 * a default [AssetDefinition] object is constructed based on the selected asset and the callback is invoked. You can either leave
 * the asset definition unmodified and do nothing (that's what the default implementation of the callback does), or adjust the properties
 * of the object, or maybe even upload the asset asset file to your server and adjust the uri property of the asset.
 * Note that the "upload" coroutine job will survive configuration changes and will be cancelled only if the editor is closed or the process is killed
 * when in the background.
 * @param onClose the callback that is invoked after a tap on the navigation icon of the toolbar or on the system back button.
 * The callback receives a boolean parameter that indicates whether editor has unsaved changes. In case the flag is true,
 * [ShowCloseConfirmationDialogEvent] event is sent in the default implementation which displays a confirmation dialog. If
 * the flag is false, the editor is closed.
 * Note that the "close" coroutine job will survive configuration changes and will be cancelled only if the editor is closed or
 * the process is killed when in the background.
 * @param onError the callback that is invoked after the editor captures an error. A [ShowErrorDialogEvent] event is sent in
 * the default implementation which displays a popup dialog with action button that closes the editor.
 * Note that the "error" coroutine job will survive configuration changes and will be cancelled only if the editor is closed or
 * the process is killed when in the background.
