/**
 * This sets up a [Transition], and updates it with the target provided by [targetState]. When
 * [targetState] changes, [Transition] will run all of its child animations towards their
 * target values specified for the new [targetState]. Child animations can be dynamically added
 * using [Transition.animateFloat], [animateColor][ androidx.compose.animation.animateColor],
 * [Transition.animateValue], etc.
 *
 * [label] is used to differentiate different transitions in Android Studio.
 *
 * __Note__: There is another [updateTransition] overload that accepts a [MutableTransitionState].
 * The difference between the two is that the [MutableTransitionState] variant: 1) supports a
 * different initial state than target state (This would allow a transition to start as soon as
 * it enters composition.) 2) can be recreated to intentionally trigger a re-start of the
 * transition.
