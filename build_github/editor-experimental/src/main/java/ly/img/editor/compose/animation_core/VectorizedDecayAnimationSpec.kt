/**
 * [VectorizedDecayAnimationSpec]s are stateless vector based decay animation specifications.
 * They do not assume any starting/ending conditions. Nor do they manage a lifecycle. All it stores
 * is the configuration that is particular to the type of the decay animation: friction multiplier
 * for [exponentialDecay]. Its stateless nature allows the same [VectorizedDecayAnimationSpec] to
 * be reused by a few different running animations with different starting and ending values.
 *
 * Since [VectorizedDecayAnimationSpec]s are stateless, it requires starting value/velocity and
 * ending value to be passed in, along with playtime, to calculate the value or velocity at that
 * time. Play time here is the progress of the animation in terms of milliseconds, where 0 means the
 * start of the animation and [getDurationNanos] returns the play time for the end of the
 * animation.
 *
 * __Note__: For use cases where the starting values/velocity and ending values aren't expected
 * to change, it is recommended to use [DecayAnimation] that caches these static values and hence
 * does not require them to be supplied in the value/velocity calculation.
 *
