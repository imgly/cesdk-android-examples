# IMGLY Creative Engine and UI - Android Examples

This repository contains the Android examples for the IMG.LY `Engine`, the core of CE.SDK, as well as the source code of our mobile editor solutions.
The `Engine` enables you to build any design editing UI, automation and creative workflow in Kotlin.
It offers performant and robust graphics processing capabilities combining the best of layout, typography and image processing with advanced workflows centered around templating and adaptation.

The `Engine` seamlessly integrates into any Android app whether you are building a photo editor, template-based design tool or scalable automation of content creation for your app.
The mobile editor is fully built on top of the `Engine`.

The full documentation of the [engine](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/engine/quickstart?platform=android) and the [mobile editor](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/mobile-editor/quickstart?platform=android) can be found on our website.
There you will learn how to integrate and configure them for your use case.
